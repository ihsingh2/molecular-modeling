# Lennard Jones System - Simulated Annealing

## Initial Configuration

Initial configuration of position and momenta can be generated by sampling from uniform and normal distribution respectively. In the case of position however, merely sampling in $[0, L]$ does not suffice. We will have to reject samples that lead to overlap with other atoms (or the "permissible distance" in the plots) and sample again.

The distribution of magnitude of momenta sampled this way roughly resembles the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, as one would expect ([source](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/536497)).

## Minimization of Potential Energy

The randomly generated configurations can be improved upon by the use of Simulated Annealing. As noted in the earlier question, this helps us strike a perfect balance between exploration and convergence. As our estimate becomes better, random exploration become less likely to lead us to a better configuration. Thus, we can start to discard the undesirable higher energy configurations more often than before.

## Comparision with Steepest Descent

We notice that both Simulated Annealing and Steepest Descent have similar performance with respect to execution time and optimization. To be more precise, Simulated Annealing has an edge with regards to execution time while Steepest Descent has an edge with respect to optimization.

## Appendix

Time taken by each algorithm in current experimental setup:
- Steepest Descent (100 steps): 5.87 seconds
- Monte Carlo @ 300K (1000 steps): 2.55 seconds
- Monte Carlo @ 200K (1000 steps): 2.67 seconds
- Monte Carlo @ 100K (1000 steps): 3.11 seconds
- Simulated Annealing @ 300-100K (2500 steps): 5.94 seconds
