Commands to load and run Gaussian/gview:

	gview
	g09 < input.com > output.log

Some Notes:
	1. Use Hartree-Fock method with STO-3G basis set. No other settings will need to be changed (except title maybe).
	2. Use Opt+Freq to make your life easy - calculates everything you may need (except scan).
	3. The 'R' icon indicates the Redundant Coordinates menu. Use this to mark dihederal angles that need scanning.
	4. Use the Scan calculation for Conformational analysis.
	5. Energy is in a.u. which is 1 Hartree. You can find converters online if needed.
	6. Gaussian will create a (sometimes quite big) .chk (checkpoint) file. This is normal. Do not panic.
	7. gview can load both input and output files. Right clicking empty space will give access to the results menu.
	8. If you are interested, check out the python package 'ase' (atomic simualtion environment); use it to automate some of your Gaussian work.
